# The body mass index (BMI) was created by a Belgian mathematician in the 1850's 
# and it's used by health and nutrition professionals to estimate human body fat in certain populations.
# It is computed by taking an individual's weight (mass) in kilograms and dividing it by the square of their height in meters.
# bmi = {mass \ heightÂ²}

weight = 80
height = 1.80

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
